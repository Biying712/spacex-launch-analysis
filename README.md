# SpaceX Launch Predictor ðŸš€

## Overview
This project applies machine learning to analyze SpaceX Falcon 9 launches with the goal of predicting first-stage recovery and estimating launch costs. By leveraging public data, we aim to understand the factors behind successful landings and provide insights into how reusable rockets drive down costs.  

This work is framed as a capstone scenario for **SpaceY**, a new competitor to SpaceX, founded by billionaire industrialist Allon Musk. As a data scientist, your role is to provide actionable insights through predictive modeling and dashboards.  

## Objectives
- Predict whether the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully.  
- Estimate the cost of each launch based on reusability.  
- Collect, clean, and analyze public launch data.  
- Build interactive dashboards for data exploration.  
- Train and evaluate machine learning models for launch outcome prediction.  

## Project Background
- The commercial space age has arrived: companies like Virgin Galactic, Rocket Lab, and Blue Origin are making space travel more accessible.  
- SpaceX leads the market with reusable Falcon 9 rockets, offering launches at ~$62M compared to ~$165M+ from competitors.  
- Reusability is the key driver of cost savings, but recovery depends on mission parameters such as payload, orbit, and customer.  

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: data analysis and machine learning  
- **Pandas, NumPy**: data wrangling  
- **Matplotlib, Plotly**: visualization and dashboards  
- **Scikit-learn**: predictive modeling  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: exploration and reporting  

## Expected Deliverables
- Clean dataset of Falcon 9 launch records  
- Visual dashboards for team insights  
- Machine learning model predicting stage recovery  
- Launch cost estimator
